Middleware in Express refers to a concept where functions have access to the request object, response object, and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. 

It acts as a bridge between the client and server, allowing for additional processing and modifications to the incoming request and outgoing response.

Middleware functions can be used for various purposes, such as handling authentication, logging, error handling, and much more. 

They are executed sequentially in the order they are defined, providing a flexible and modular way to handle different aspects of the application's functionality.
